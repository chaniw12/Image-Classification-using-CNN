# Image Classification using CNN
## Overview
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify different types of images.

## Data Description
The dataset contains images of dog, cat, car and bike. It has been split by training, validation and test sets to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on different data. 

## Modelling
Explore two different approaches: training from scratch and transfer learning. Build the NN layers and tune hyperparameters based on the results obtained during training. Evaluate the model performance using the test set accuracy metric.
